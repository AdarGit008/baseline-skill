# Changelog

All notable changes to the `/baseline` skill are documented here. The format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); the runner is versioned in
`rules.json` and `SKILL.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — V2 M4c: the record checks — REC/FLOW rules, claims explosion, the push-boundary scrub
- **`rules/rec.json`** (78 rules total, 13 modules) — REC-01 **append-only proof** from history
  (`--diff-filter=MDR` events + a blob-at-introduction comparison closing the CF7 delete-recreate
  and merge-hidden holes; shallow history = SKIP, never a guess), REC-02 **landed-records scrub**
  (the same `scan()` as the write gate; deterministic findings fail — M7's promotion is a pure
  severity flip — heuristics stay soft), REC-04 **one-home duplication detector** (warn-pinned per
  CF10), REC-05 **push-time gate delegation** (F7: PASSes by delegating to push-protection/gitleaks
  evidence; warns when nothing owns the push boundary).
- **`rules/flow.json`** — FLOW-02 (a lane carries its own session record) + FLOW-06 (a gated
  subject changes with its record in the same range — the DESC-03 preview, CF9). Both are
  **data-gated, not special-cased**: rules declare `workflow`/`branch_scope`, the engine turns
  them into SKIPs on single-lane repos, missing descriptors, and the default branch — "no
  wallpaper warns" is structural. `--self-check` validates the new fields.
- **Claims explosion (C17)** — `baseline gen migrate-claims` writes per-claim
  `records/claims/CLM-NNNN.json` (V1 id survives as `slug`, numbering continues past existing
  records, O_EXCL, schema-invalid claims refused per claim, idempotent). The CLAIM checks
  **dual-read** both homes (records shadow migrated legacy ids) until M7; CLAIM-07 warns the
  monolith into motion; CLAIM-00 accepts either home. Activation is **maturity-gated** (C24):
  descriptor `prototype` skips CLAIM unless explicitly opted in — the skip says why.
- **`baseline scrub`** — the pre-push hook's engine: worktree files or `--pushed SHA
  [--since SHA]` committed-blob ranges; `--allow <id> --allow-reason "..."` writes the same dated
  allowlist judgments as `log`/`jdg`. **`hooks/scrub-pre-push.sh`** scaffolds the push-boundary
  layer for hand-written records (missing runtime fails OPEN with a loud warning — documented
  residual risk; REC-02 in CI is the backstop).
- **`status_file: false` honored** with a valid descriptor present (M4 ruling item 7): CTX-01 and
  CTX-12 skip as `opted out`; without a descriptor the opt-out is refused with the fix named —
  a bare repo can't silence CTX by config alone. Relief for derived-orient repos ahead of M7.
- Engine threading: `runRules` now receives the descriptor, current branch, and declared default
  branch; `FIELD_CONSUMERS` flips `workflow`/`ground_truth_boundary`/`maturity` to active (S7);
  `lifecycle` re-reserved to M7 (M4 shipped no consumer — #24 decides consume-or-drop).
- Suite +42 assertions (engine gates, REC evaluators against real history, the lane loop
  end-to-end, gen/scrub e2e); golden harness gains deterministic `git init -b main` + a
  `_branch/` lane-commit overlay; new **`flow-repo`** fixture pins FLOW-02 PASS / FLOW-06 WARN /
  REC-01 WARN / CTX opt-out SKIPs at 0 blockers. Corpus re-pin is additive — every pre-M4c
  verdict unchanged.

### Added — V2 M4b: the judgment ledger — `baseline jdg`, the machine contract, one sign-off home
- **`src/jdg.mjs`** — the unified ledger surface. `jdg new` authors schema-valid, scrub-gated,
  numbered `records/judgments/JDG-NNNN.json` (break-glass ⇒ `--gate admit|reconcile`; `--review-by`
  mandatory — every judgment expires); `jdg check` evaluates every judgment's **machine contract**
  against derived facts: `expected_state` mismatch = DRIFTED, `tripwire` fired = TRIPPED,
  `review_by` past = EXPIRED, unknown fact path = UNRESOLVABLE (surfaced, never guessed — C36).
  Worst-wins lattice; exit 1 on tripped/expired/invalid. Fact namespace: `descriptor.*` ·
  `planes.*` · `git.*` · `today`, with a `--facts` overlay (fixtures now, M6's reconcile sweep later).
- **signoff→JDG bridge** — a `kind: sign-off` judgment whose `subject` is a manual rule's id
  satisfies it while unexpired; a **lapsed sign-off is honestly NOT signed** and outranks the
  eternal legacy entry. Legacy `.project-baseline/signoff.json` keeps byte-identical V1 semantics
  until M7. New golden fixture **`jdg-repo`** pins the JDG-only path (0 blockers, no signoff.json);
  re-capture normalized pin key order to the post-split output order (verified zero semantic drift).
- **`CONTRACT.md`** — the plain-git twin (C28): the orient-first/log-last loop, record homes +
  hand-written forms, the judgment machine contract + numbering/merge-renumbering, the scrub gate,
  the **FS5 break-glass discipline** (own prior PR on main; enforcement lands at M6 admit), and
  the reserved M5/M6/M7 surfaces. Ships with installs.
- **Deferred-from-M4a consolidations** — `util.mjs` gains `makeOpt`/`makeOptText`/`makeOptAll`
  (check/orient/log/jdg share one argv parser) and `FRONTMATTER_RE` (one boundary opinion; fixes
  doc-freshness's LF-only regex that made CRLF-saved docs invisible to CTX-06). Corpus-proof.
- Suite grows to **87 assertions** incl. the DESC-03-shape acceptance bullet: a descriptor-change
  JDG validates and its tripwire fires on posture weakening.
- **Review pass (4-angle adversarial, all findings fixed):** evaluator findings are structured
  (`{code, fact, want, got, text}` — M6 dedup-keys firings without parsing prose) and `facts.today`
  is the ONE clock (overlays time-travel expiry too); the signoff bridge loads via the strict
  `loadJudgments` + `selectSignoffs` (a malformed `review_by` can never read as signed-forever);
  one clock helper (`util.nowUTC`) ends the raw-env `TODAY` slice; `deepEq` is order-insensitive
  (JSON key order is not a changed world); tripwire values keep inner whitespace verbatim;
  `jdg new` blocks are non-lossy (draft + `--from` replay) with the same `--allow/--allow-reason`
  surface as `log` (log's allowlist flag renamed from `--reason`, which `jdg` needs for the
  judgment itself); value flags refuse to swallow a following flag (`--repo`/`--by`/`--facts`
  followed by a flag is a usage error, not a record attributed to "true"); the forge probe is
  skipped unless a judgment references `planes.forge`; `liteRepo` (repo.mjs) replaces the third
  hand-rolled repo shim. Behavior note: doc-freshness's CRLF fix means a CRLF doc whose stamp sat
  in the body (outside frontmatter) no longer passes by accident — LF and CRLF now agree.

### Added — V2 M4a: the Ledger's shapes — rules split, record schemas, `baseline log` + scrub
- **`rules/` split (11 per-category modules) behind a manifest loader** (`src/rules.mjs`):
  `rules.json` keeps the runner's identity (name/version/project_types/profiles) plus the ordered
  module list. Corpus-neutral by construction — stable partition, pins keyed by rule id. Unblocks
  M5's "extends `rules/flow.json`" premise (#22) and M4c's `rules/rec.json`. One externally visible
  change: `--json` `results` order is now category-grouped (the late-added rules interleave into
  their categories instead of sitting at the tail) — verdicts, ids, and the human report are
  unchanged; positional consumers of `results[i]` must key by id. The loader fails LOUD on a
  manifest without `modules` (stale monolith skew) and on a `rules/*.json` file the manifest
  doesn't list — a rule can't exist yet silently never run.
- **Record schemas** — `schema/record.{session,judgment,claim,adr}.schema.json`, validated by the
  descriptor's zero-dep subset validator (now shared as `src/validate.mjs`); `src/records.mjs` is
  the kind registry + frontmatter/ADR-header seam. The judgment schema **expresses break-glass**
  (kind + `gate`) — FS5 *enforcement* stays M6, per the #21 amendment. Templates: `session-log.md`,
  `judgment.json`, `claim.json`.
- **`src/scrub.mjs`** — one `scan()` for every layer (C34): the deterministic tier (SEC-01 parity
  + JWT + fine-grained PAT) blocks; the heuristic tier (assignment shapes, entropy-floored blobs —
  a 40-hex commit SHA never trips) warns; deterministic spans are censored before the heuristic
  pass so one value never reports under two names. `.baseline/scrub-allowlist.json` holds **dated
  judgments keyed by content-derived finding id** — the flagged value itself is never stored.
- **`baseline log`** — the pinned one-liner (#21 amendment, item 4): `baseline log -m "..."
  [--next "..."]`; lane/agent/timestamp derived (lane = branch, unborn branches included — the M5
  seam), stdin accepted, never `$EDITOR`. Writes `records/sessions/<lane>/<date>-<time>-<agent>.md`
  (CF1: `O_EXCL`, no counters) in exactly the `## Left open` / `next:` shape orient already reads.
  Scrub blocks are **non-lossy**: the full draft survives under `.baseline/cache/` and the exact
  rerun is printed (`--from <draft> --allow <finding-id> --reason "..."`).
- **`test/records/run.mjs`** (41 assertions, a CI step): lossless split, per-kind schema
  accept/reject, scrub tiers + allowlist + finding-id stability, log end-to-end including the
  orient round-trip, O_EXCL collision refusal, and draft replay with a dated judgment.
- Ruling record: the #21 amendment comment (FS5 rewording · REC-02 warn resolution · `rec.json`
  home · pinned log UX · hardened dogfood acceptance) and the M7 delete-list addition on #24.

### Added — V2 M3d: the Hermes plugin (M3 complete)
- **`integrations/hermes/baseline-orient/`** — a NousResearch hermes-agent plugin that opens each
  session oriented: a `register(ctx)` entry point registering an **`on_session_start`** hook and an
  **`/orient`** slash command, both shelling out to `baseline orient`. No provider keys, no network of
  its own.
- Grounded in the official hermes-agent plugin API (`ctx.register_hook` over `VALID_HOOKS`,
  `ctx.register_command`) — **not** the memory-provider `prefetch`/`system_prompt_block` surface the
  plan originally sketched (those are `MemoryProvider` methods, not general hooks).
- Conformance-authored: valid Python + `plugin.yaml`, structured like the official reference plugins,
  but **not runtime-tested** (no Hermes on the authoring box). The `/orient` command is spec-confirmed;
  the `on_session_start` injection return-shape needs one verification pass on a live Hermes.

### Added — V2 M3c: rule metadata backfill + CTX-12 (the Lens's contract)
- **Every rule now declares `sources` / `on_unreachable` / `contexts` / `certainty`** (introspectable
  data): which ground-truth planes it reads, what it does when one is unreachable, the contexts it
  runs in, and how certain its verdict is. 38 deterministic, 28 heuristic, 5 judgment.
- **`--self-check` enforces two structural laws** (STRATA graft): a **blocker must be deterministic**
  and a **sign-off must be judgment** — plus per-field validity and a layering check (readiness rules
  can't consume FLOW facts, inert until M5). The existing rule set satisfies both with zero conflicts.
- **CTX-12** — the stored-status **tripwire** (71 rules total): warns when a hand-maintained
  `last-verified:` stamp is present (the artifact V2 replaces with derived `orient`). Warn now while
  CTX-01 still gates the stamp; promotes to blocker once migration completes (M7).
- Golden corpus re-pinned: only CTX-12 added (metadata fields are inert to verdicts).

### Deferred (M3 continues)
- **M3d** — the Hermes `prefetch`/`system_prompt_block` plugin (needs the Hermes plugin API).

### Added — V2 M3b: the typed Lens plumbing
- **`src/facts/{tree,git,forge}.mjs`** — typed, provenance-carrying facts. The forge adapter wraps
  `gh` with **record/replay**: `BASELINE_FORGE_REPLAY=<dir>` reads committed fixtures (deterministic,
  no network) and `BASELINE_FORGE_RECORD=<dir>` captures them, so downstream lane/admit tests replay
  a fixed forge. (Batched GraphQL is deferred to fleet scale — M5.)
- **`.baseline/cache/facts.ndjson`** (`src/cache.mjs`) — gitignored, advisory-only (gates never read
  it, FS8); write-through on live fetch, `observed_at` per entry.
- **`src/join.mjs`** + **`schema/keys.md`** — the relational join over declared keys only (C38):
  PR⇄branch and PR⇄issue (`closes #N`) active now; record joins declared but inert until M4/M5. An
  unresolvable join is a **finding, never a guess**.
- **`src/derive/status.mjs`** — a pure function (facts + join → the derived status view), replayable;
  surfaces divergence first (next:→closed issue, closed-issue-live-branch).
- **`orient` refactored onto `facts → join → derive → render`** — one forge path; it gains the cache
  + record/replay and the same fixtures. `orient --json` now emits the derived-status shape
  (`planes` / `forgeAvailable` / `thisLane` / `findings`).
- `test/facts/run.mjs` — deterministic scenario over committed replay fixtures (clean close,
  divergence, unresolvable-join finding); wired into CI. (M3c + M3d remain — see `docs/v2/PLAN.md` §8.)

### Added — V2 M3a: `baseline orient` (the Lens goes live)
- **`baseline.mjs`** — the unified CLI entry point. `orient` is new; `check` (the default)
  delegates to the intact `check.mjs`, so the golden corpus and CI keep invoking it directly.
- **`baseline orient`** — a derived-state survey for session start (C16): a capability header
  (tree / history / forge reachability), divergence first, live lanes (open PRs + each branch's
  latest session `next:`), backlog (open issues by milestone), and this lane's `next:`.
  `gh`-based, descriptor-aware, `--json` / `--strict`. Generalizes the ADR-0009 `orient.mjs`.
- **Capability probe** (`src/probe.mjs`) — plane reachability; every unreachable plane degrades
  to a labelled note, so orient works offline and **never hard-refuses** (C33 / FS9); `--strict`
  turns forge-unreachability into exit 1.
- **Claude Code SessionStart hook** (`hooks/orient-session-start.sh` + `hooks/README.md`) runs
  orient as the session's first act; SKILL.md carries the tool-agnostic first-act directive (C28).
- `test/orient/run.mjs` — availability tests (offline / no-forge degradation), wired into CI.

### Deferred (M3 continues in later slices)
- Typed facts layer + `.baseline/cache` + `src/join.mjs` + `derive/status.mjs` + forge
  record/replay fixtures (M3b); the `sources/on_unreachable/contexts/certainty` metadata backfill
  + CTX-12 (M3c); the Hermes `prefetch`/`system_prompt_block` plugin (M3d).

### Added — V2 M2: the repo descriptor
- **`baseline.repo.json`** — the schema-validated repo descriptor (C39): the one stored piece
  of intent every applicability/severity derivation consumes. Declares `type`, `lifecycle`,
  `maturity`, `owner`, `workflow`, `anchoring` (+ optional forge / lanes / join-keys / staleness).
  Schema at `schema/repo.schema.json`, loaded and validated by a zero-dependency subset validator
  in `src/descriptor.mjs`. Read from the working tree or a git ref (the target-ref seam).
- **`type` supersedes filesystem auto-detection** when a valid descriptor is present, so a tooling
  `package.json` can't misclassify a docs repo as `node`; absent/invalid → auto-detect still governs.
- **DESC-01** (new `desc` category — 70 rules across 11 categories): descriptor absent or
  schema-invalid → WARN + scaffold fix; present and valid → PASS. Transitional — adopt incrementally.
- **Posture presets** `config-presets/multi-lane-agents.repo.json` (the V2 default) and
  `readiness-only.repo.json` (V1-equivalent), plus the `templates/baseline.repo.json` scaffold.
- **`--self-check`** now enforces the descriptor invariant (S7 / DESC-02): every schema field has a
  declared consumer (active, or reserved for a named later module).
- **`init` is descriptor-first** — writes `baseline.repo.json` before anything else; no longer
  scaffolds a status doc.
- Golden corpus: two new fixtures (`descriptor-repo`, `descriptor-invalid`); pins re-captured.

### Deferred (honest slice)
- **DESC-03** (descriptor change-control) and **target-ref *enforcement*** are wired at the loader
  seam but not yet active — their teeth need JDG records (M4) and the `admit` context (M6). See
  `docs/v2/PLAN.md` §8.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- `REFERENCE.md` — the full reference (rule table, category descriptions, CI wiring)
  plus **architecture & flow diagrams** drawn from `check.mjs`.
- `GLOSSARY.md` — plain-language definitions of the DevOps/supply-chain terms, linked
  from the docs. Both are copied on install.
- Distribution-mode self-scoring: `baseline.config.json` (`project_type: docs`) so the
  repo is scored against the rules that fit a distribution repo, plus a status doc,
  sign-off ledger, `SECURITY.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, and this changelog.
- **`project_types` + explicit `applies_to` on every rule**, and a `--self-check`
  mode that validates rule-set integrity (no missing/typo'd `applies_to`, unknown
  check kind, profile, severity, category, `requires` key, or duplicate id) and prints
  a per-type coverage matrix. Guards against silently-dangling rules.
- **Hermes-native:** `SKILL.md` now uses the Hermes peer conventions (frontmatter
  superset with `author`/`license`/`platforms`/`metadata.hermes`, "Use when…"
  description, peer structure) while staying valid for Claude Code. `install.sh --hermes`
  installs into `~/.hermes/skills/software-development/baseline`.
- `config-presets/` — ready-made `baseline.config.json` starting points
  (context-management, node-service, python-library, internal-tool, product-with-claims),
  each annotated and copied on install.

### Changed
- Removed an internal end-of-session reference from CTX-01's `fix` text.
- Genericized the v1 provenance line (dropped specific private repo names).
- Re-scoped TEST-03/TEST-04 to code repos (`node`/`python`/`service`/`library`); a
  docs/distribution repo now skips them instead of needing "n/a" sign-offs.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-07-05

### Changed
- Bulletproofing pass: 62 defects fixed across 4 adversarial rounds (severity
  inversion in CTX-01, a shell-injection in the git helpers → `execFileSync`,
  comment-blind greps → quote-aware stripping); ~70 regression assertions green.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- Backfilled 8 rules (SEC-11/12/14, QUAL-04, BUILD-10, TEST-07, CTX-11) and 3 check
  kinds (workflow-permissions, implies, doc-code-age). The standard is now **69 rules**.
